# SimpleImageViewer
View images/sequences from folder, because windows photo viewer fails when you try to view hundreds of image frames quickly.

## Features
- View images from single folder, with arrow keys to move between images (frames)
- Faster than (original) Windows Photo Viewer (it shows "loading" and eventually goes blank, if hold arrow keys down to look through sequences)
- (soon) Better UX and features than new Windows Photos app
